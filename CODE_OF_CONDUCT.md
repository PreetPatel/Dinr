# Blue Butterfly Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project contributors are expected to have excellent communication skills, utilising
platforms such as Discord, Slack or Messenger, to keep fellow contributors
upto date and informed with their progress and availability.

As we are all students it is understandable that people's availability will
vary and contributors will have a varying range of experience with the 
employed technologies. In consideration of these circumstances we encourage
consistent questions and communication between team members to ensure that
no one feels left behind.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Conflict
It is encouraged that any conflict be resloved internally. This conflict should
amount to no more than healthy disscusion and debate regarding the project. If
anyone feels that conversation has progressed beyond this into the realms of 
bullying or discrimination not that this will **NOT** be tolerated and the lecturer
Andrew Meads should be contacted immediately to seek a resolution.
