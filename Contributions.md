## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- For larger changes split commit messages into a subject line and a body

  For example:

```
  $ git commit -m "Subject line, contains a brief summary of the changes
  >
  > The body, describes what has changed and why"
```

- One-line messages are appropriate for small changes
- Use the present tense e.g. ("Add button" not "Added button")
- Use the imperative mood e.g. ("Move button to..." not "Moves button to...")
- For more in-depth guidelines (but not required) see [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
