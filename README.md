# Dinr - Because restaurants can't swipe left!
*Presented by Blue Butterfly (Group 3)*

Dinr is a mobile application that makes choosing a restaurant to eat at easier for all the indecisive people out there. Simply join a session with a group of friends and swipe away at restaurants. When the time is up, discover your group's top picks.

This group project is part of the SOFTENG 750: Software Development Methodologies course. For more information about this project and the application, you can refer to our [Wiki.](https://github.com/PreetPatel/Dinr/wiki)

You can view more detailed, module-specific setup information in the README's in the [./server](https://github.com/PreetPatel/Dinr/tree/master/server) and [./mobile-app](https://github.com/PreetPatel/Dinr/tree/master/mobile-app) subfolders!
