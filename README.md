Dinr is a mobile application that makes it easier to discover new restaurants and decide on where to eat (for all the indecisive people out there). Simply set up a session, invite your friends and swipe away. When the time is up, the application will recommend the three top restaurants based off all your preferences.

This application was developed as a submission for our group project in the _SOFTENG 750: Software Development Methodologies_ course. For more information about this project and the application, you can refer to our [Wiki.](https://github.com/PreetPatel/Dinr/wiki)

You can view more detailed, module-specific setup information in the README's in the [./server](https://github.com/PreetPatel/Dinr/tree/master/server) and [./mobile-app](https://github.com/PreetPatel/Dinr/tree/master/mobile-app) subfolders!
